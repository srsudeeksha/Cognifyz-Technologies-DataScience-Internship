# Cognifyz Data Science Internship

## üìå Overview
This repository contains my work for the **Cognifyz Data Science Internship Program**.  
The internship focuses on applying **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Visualization** skills to solve real-world problems in the restaurant domain.  

The tasks are divided into three levels, and I have worked on selected tasks from each level to demonstrate my technical skills and analytical approach.
